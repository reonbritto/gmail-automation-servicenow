# CODING STANDARDS & BEST PRACTICES
Scripting Language: JavaScript (ES5/ES6 features where supported by ServiceNow version)
Code Comments: Mandatory for complex logic and all public functions/Script Includes.
Naming Conventions:
  - Business Rules: BR - [Table] - [Short Description] (e.g., BR - Incident - Set Caller Location)
  - Script Includes: SI - [UtilityName] (e.g., SI - UserUtils)
  - Client Scripts: CS - [Table] - [Action] (e.g., CS - Incident - Validate Priority)
  - Update Sets: [Story/Task ID]_[DeveloperInitials]_[ShortDescription]_[Version] (e.g., STR00123_AC_IncidentEnhancements_v1.0)
Error Handling: Use try-catch blocks for external API calls and complex server-side scripts. Log errors using gs.error().
Performance: Avoid GlideRecord in loops where possible. Use GlideAggregate for counts/sums. Be mindful of synchronous GlideAjax calls.

# COMMON SCRIPTS & API NOTES
## GlideRecord Examples
Querying Incidents:
  var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
  grIncident.addQuery('active', true);
  grIncident.addQuery('priority', 1);
  grIncident.query();
  while (grIncident.next()) {
    gs.info('Incident Number: ' + grIncident.getValue('number'));
  }

Creating a Task:
  var grTask = new GlideRecord('task');
  grTask.initialize();
  grTask.setValue('short_description', 'New task created via script');
  grTask.setValue('assignment_group', 'sys_id_of_service_desk_group'); // Replace with actual sys_id
  var taskSysId = grTask.insert();
  gs.info('New task created: ' + taskSysId);

## Script Include Usage
Example Script Include 'MyDateTimeUtils':
  var MyDateTimeUtils = Class.create();
  MyDateTimeUtils.prototype = {
      initialize: function() {
      },
      getFormattedCurrentDateTime: function() {
          var gdt = new GlideDateTime();
          return gdt.getDisplayValue();
      },
      type: 'MyDateTimeUtils'
  };

Calling it:
  var dtUtils = new global.MyDateTimeUtils(); // Use 'global.' if calling from scoped app to global
  var now = dtUtils.getFormattedCurrentDateTime();
  gs.info(now);

## REST API Integration
Common Endpoint (Example): /api/now/table/{tableName}
Authentication: Basic Auth or OAuth (check instance security settings)
Headers:
  - Accept: application/json
  - Content-Type: application/json
Note: Always use a dedicated integration user with minimal necessary roles.
