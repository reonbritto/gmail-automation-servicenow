response_task:
  description: >
    Fetch unread emails from Gmail (already done in the before_kickoff step and saved to 'output/fetched_emails.json').

    For each email or ServiceNow technical ticket:
      - Analyze the content and determine if a response is needed.
      - Generate a response ONLY for important personal or business emails, or technical ServiceNow tickets that require your attention, investigation, or input.
      - DO NOT generate responses for newsletters, promotions, automated notifications, spam, or emails/tickets that do not need a reply or are already resolved.

    For communications requiring a response:
      1. Draft a professional and appropriate reply.
      2. Maintain the original tone and context (e.g., formal, collaborative, supportive).
      3. Address all questions, issues, or requests in the email/ticket.
      4. For technical tickets (especially Azure, Kubernetes, or DevOps-related):
         - Provide concise, actionable guidance or troubleshooting steps.
         - Recommend next steps or escalation paths if required.
         - Include relevant documentation or official links (e.g., Microsoft Learn, Azure Docs, Kubernetes Docs, DevOps pipeline guides).
      5. Include a suitable signature (e.g., "Best regards, Reon").
      6. Use the 'save_email_draft' tool with:
         - subject: Add "Re: " to the original subject if not already present
         - body: Your response
         - recipient: The sender's email address
         - thread_info: Include if responding to a thread

    Your final answer should be a summary of the emails and tickets you processed, indicating which ones received draft responses and which did not require a response.
  expected_output: >
    A report of draft emails and ticket replies saved to the drafts folder, with information about which communications received responses and which did not require a response. Each entry should include the email/ticket ID, subject, recipient, and whether a draft was saved.
